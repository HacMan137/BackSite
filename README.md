## Description

BackSite provides out-of-the-box support for everything you need to get your latest website up and running. The purpose of this project is to provide a flexible, easy to understand groundwork for developing the web API for your next project. All of the annoying stuff has been taken care of:

- Blog/News post creation and management
- Search functionality
- Timeline feeds
- User session cleanup

BackSite is designed to be used behind an NGINX proxy which may also service a web UI to interact with the application.
